    <short_description>Prints a Collatz Sequence.</short_description>
    <long_description>Prints sequence A006877, up to 16500000, of the numbers that take more steps than any smaller number to reach 1 in the Collatz Algorithm.  The Collatz Algorithm is a recursive function that takes n and returns n/2 if n is even, or (3*n)+1 if n is odd.  It has not been proven that every number greater than 1 will eventually return to 1, but computers have shown they do up to exceedingly large numbers.</long_description>
